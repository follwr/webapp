   - Form validation and error handling

2. **`/app/start-earning/page.tsx`** - Menu redirect
   - Redirects to `/creator-signup`
   - Linked from navbar "Start Earning" menu item

3. **`/app/banking/connect/return/page.tsx`** - Stripe Connect success
   - Handles Stripe onboarding completion
   - Success/error states
   - Redirects back to banking or feed

4. **`/app/banking/connect/refresh/page.tsx`** - Stripe Connect refresh
   - Handles when user needs to restart Stripe onboarding
   - Redirects back to banking page

5. **`/app/banking/page.tsx`** - Updated with Stripe Connect
   - Shows "Connect with Stripe" button if not connected
   - Real balance fetching from backend
   - Real payment cards display
   - Creator/non-creator states

## 🏦 Stripe Connect Integration

### How It Works

1. **Creator visits Banking page** (`/banking`)
   - If not connected: Shows "Connect with Stripe" banner
   
2. **Click "Connect with Stripe"**
   - Calls `POST /banking/connect` backend API
   - Backend creates Stripe Connect Express account
   - Returns `onboardingUrl`
   
3. **Redirect to Stripe**
   - User completes KYC on Stripe's hosted page
   - Provides bank account info
   - Stripe validates identity
   
4. **Redirect back to app**
   - Success: `/banking/connect/return` (shows success page)
   - Refresh needed: `/banking/connect/refresh` (restarts flow)

### Backend Flow

```typescript
// Backend: banking.service.ts

1. createConnectAccount()
   - Creates Stripe Connect Express account
   - Links to creator's userId
   - Generates account onboarding link
   
2. Returns:
   {
     accountId: "acct_xxx",
     onboardingUrl: "https://connect.stripe.com/setup/..."
   }
   
3. Saves to database:
   - payout_accounts.stripe_connect_account_id
   - creator_profiles.stripe_account_id
```

### Environment Setup

Backend requires these Stripe env vars:
```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxx
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxx
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

Frontend uses existing `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`

## 🐛 Known Issues / Limitations

1. **Stripe Test Mode**: Currently using test mode, needs production keys for live
2. **No Image Upload**: Profile/cover images require separate upload flow
3. **Single Subscription Tier**: Backend supports multi-tier, frontend only single price
4. **No Email Notifications**: Creators don't receive confirmation emails yet
5. **No Undo**: Once creator, can't downgrade (by design, but might add)

---

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify backend is running and accessible
3. Check Stripe API keys are configured
4. Verify database migrations are applied
5. Check network tab for API call failures
